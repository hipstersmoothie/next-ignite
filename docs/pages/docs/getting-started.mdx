`ignite` is distributed on `npm`.

```bash
npm i --save-dev ignite
# or
yarn add -d ignite
```

## Setup

Getting setup with `ignite` require you to create a few files in addition to all of your actual documentation.

### Quick

To quickly get started using `ignite` just run one of the following commands.
This will setup a minimal docs folder so you can get straight to documenting.

```bash
# using npm
npx ignite init

# using yarn
yarn ignite init
```

### Manual

First create a folder named `docs` and structure it to resemble the following.

```bash
📦docs
 ┣ 📂pages
 ┃ ┣ 📂docs
 ┃ ┃ ┣ index.mdx
 ┃ ┣ _app.js
```

You **must have**:

- `pages/_app.js`
- `pages/docs/index.mdx`

Add the following to your `.gitignore`.

```gitignore
.next
.mdx-data
docs/public/search-index.json
```

#### `_app.tsx`

You need to at least do the following:

1. Import `MDXProvider`, `igniteComponents`, and combine the at the root of the app
2. Import `ignite`'s css
3. Import a `prismjs` theme to style the code block

```jsx
import React from "react";
import App from "next/app";
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { igniteComponents } from "next-ignite";

// Import a prismjs theme to highlight the code blocks
// Make sure to import this first! The order matters
import "prismjs/themes/prism.css";
// Import the css to style the docs
import "ignite/dist/main.css";

class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props;

    return (
      <MDXProvider components={igniteComponents}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  }
}

export default MyApp;
```

#### Start writing docs :tada:

Now that you have all that set up you can start writing documentation!
All you need to do is start adding `.mdx` files to `pages/docs`.
A good one to start with is `pages/docs/index.mdx` since this will be the first page shown to the user.

**`pages/docs/index.mdx`:**

```mdx
---
title: "My Introduction"
---

The start of my amazing documentation.
```

Now start up the development server:

```sh
yarn ignite dev
```

Once it's done loading you should see that that your documentation has loaded and `ignite` automatically created a sidebar for you! :astonished:
